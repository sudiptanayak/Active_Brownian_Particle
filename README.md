# Active_Brownian_Particle
My code for my master's thesis 
It creates 2 classes: 'particles' and 'arena'
Particle: Each instance of particle has 3 attributes, x,y and theta corresponding to x and y coordinate of particle and the orientation of particle respectively.
Arena: Refers to the space that contains all the particles and has dimensions of box size along length and bredth

There are functions to initialise the arena and visualise it.
Once an arena has been created and initialised with particles, we simulate the dynamics of particles subject to differential equations corresponding to overdampened newtonian dynamics with forces being generated by WCA potential.
We store the x,y and theta coordinates of particles.
